# Food Safety Challenge
In an effort to support their restaurant review work, a British magazine has approached us to help evaluate restaurant food safety data put out by the UK government. To do this, we completed the following activities:

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
We imported the restaurant food safety data (.json file) into Jupyter Notebook and then linked this with MongoDB.

## Part 2: Update the Database
Next, our client asked us to prepare the database for beginning the analysis. To this end, we added a new restaurant that they were interested in into the database and, also per their request, filtered out restaurants from a particular municipality (Dover).

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Once the database was prepared, we began the exploratory analysis and were able to answer the following questions:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
    -There were 41 establishments with a hygeine score of 20
    
2. Which establishments in London have a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4?
   - There were 33 establishments in London with a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4


3. What are the top 5 establishments with a Rating Value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to `Penang Flavours`?
    - We were unable to make the code work.

4. How many establishments in each Local Authority Area have a hygiene score of 0?
    - There were 55 total establishments with a hygeine score of 0.
